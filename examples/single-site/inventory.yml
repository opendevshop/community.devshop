# Services Hosts
# Each web service is defined by an Ansible group, as yml files in the ./services folder.
# They contain variables that tell the platform what roles and variables to apply to make the service work.
# Make sure you have at least one host in each required group for your app.
# The same host can provide multiple services as roles and variables are combined.
