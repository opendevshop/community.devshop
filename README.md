# DevShop.Platform Collection for Ansible

[![CI](https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop.platform/actions/workflows/ansible-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop.platform/actions/workflows/ansible-test.yml)

The DevShop.Platform Ansible collection extends Ansible's reach to track applications and services, in addition to hosts and roles.

## Components

1. App Hosts. "Virtual" Ansible host entries that reference a running instance of an application. (a.k.a. an "app environment".).
2. Service Groups. A "service" is an abstract list of roles that provides something to App Hosts. Any host assigned to a Service Group becomes a "Server Host".
3. Server Hosts. Ansible host entries that provide "services" to applications. Once assigned, the list of `devshop_server_roles` is aggregated from the Service Group variable `devshop_service_roles_NAME`.
4. App Roles. Meta roles to install applications of pre-defined types, such as Drupal or node.

```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the `ansible` package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax to install version `0.1.0`:

```bash
