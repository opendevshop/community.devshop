      - name: Disable AppArmoDuring a workflow run, files are uploaded and downloaded individually using the upload-artifact and download-artifact actions. However, when a workflow run finishes and an artifact is downloaded from either the UI or through the download api, a zip is dynamically created with all the file contents that were uploaded. There is currently no way to download artifacts after a workflow run finishes in a format other than a zip or to download artifact contents individually. One of the consequences of this limitation is that if a zip is uploaded during a workflow run and then downloaded from the UI, there will be a double zip created.r on Debian.
